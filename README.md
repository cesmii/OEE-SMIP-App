# OEE-SMIP-App

A GraphQL-based web App for the CESMII SM Innovation Platform.

This app uses a ThinkIQ Library, including standard Type definitions (available in the CESMII Cloud Library) that computes OEE, and its component functions, for any equipment (given a few key datapoints).

The app is written in pure Javascript (Vue) using the GraphQL API provided by the instance of the SMIP the user logs into. For more details, see the [frontend/README.md](frontend/README.md).
